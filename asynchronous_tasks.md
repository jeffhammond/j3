# Asynchronous Tasks in Fortran

## Introduction

The principle of asynchrony is fundamental to many aspects of computing,
and appears in many forms, many of which already overlap with the use of
Fortran.  Fortran supports asynchronous execution already via coarrays,
since two images execute independent of one another unless explicitly
synchronized.  However, some use cases for asynchrony are a poor fit for
coarrays, either due to the need for data to be distributed across images
and explicitly communicated between them, or because the number of images
is fixed and - except for termination - does not change throughout the
execution of a program.

It is also possible to achieve asynchrony using DO CONCURRENT, but this
assumes that an implementation generates the appropriate type of paralleism
required for asynchronous execution.  In any case, DO CONCURRENT imposes
a number of restrictions on the code that can be executed within that scope,
particularly that impure procedures are not permitted.  This excludes the
possibility of long-running and/or complex tasks that cannot be contorted
to fit within the scope of a single DO CONCURRENT region.

## Related Efforts

Ada, C and C++ are ISO languages with support for asynchronous
execution in one form another, with features introduced in
1995, 2011 and 2011, respectively.  We will briefly highlight the
asynchronous parts of these languages below.

Within the domain of high-performance computing (HPC), the standardized
directives known as OpenMP and OpenACC support asynchronous execution,
which is used in Fortran applications today.  The use cases for
directive-based asynchronous execution in Fortran applications provide
use cases for the features we are proposing.

### Ada Tasks

Ada has tasks a first-class feature in the language.  Ada tasks are
similar to OS threads, in that they can act asynchronously relative
to their parent, and can act on data from the parent scope, for
example with a discriminate (argument) that is a pointer to data
allocated and initialized elsewhere.
In contrast to coarrays, Ada tasks can be created and destroyed
within a program, tasks can create and wait on additional tasks,
and tasks can access global variables.

### C Threads

The ISO C11 language introduced both threads and atomic operations,
which are primitives that allow the implementation of asynchronous
execution similar to Ada tasks.  For example, the user can spawn
a thread, provide it with pointers to data that it can manipulate.
Because C provides nothing like Ada's protected objects, users
must take care and use atomic operations when multiple threads
access data concurrently.  Users can also built their own protected
accesses using mutexes.

### C++ Threads

C++11 added equivalent features to C11 - threads, atomics, mutexes -
as well as related features like async, promise and future.
In later versions of the standard, C++ has introduced parallel
algorithms (e.g. std::for_each, which has the ability to behave
like Fortran 2008 DO CONCURRENT).

### OpenMP Tasks

OpenMP 3.1 introduced tasks on top of the existing threading model.
The 3.1 version of tasks did not support dependencies, other than
parent tasks waiting on child tasks.  In OpenMP 4.0, task
dependencies were introduced, which permitted the synchronization
of tasks using memory locations as identifiers.  The implementation
of task dependencies is considerably more complicated, and is
a cautionary tale for Fortran.

### OpenACC Async

OpenACC has `async`, which provides a queue-like mechanism for
allowing asynchronous execution of certain features.  This is
a natural match when OpenACC targets another device, such as a
GPU, which naturally executes asynchronously relative to the
host controlling it.

OpenACC `async` does not allow interactions between different
asynchonrous regions, and furthermore offers multiple streams
of asynchrony, enumerated as integers.  Because asynchronous
regions cannot interact, it is legal for an implementation to
ignore asynchrony and wait for completion of such regions
before proceeding.  This allows naive implementations or ones
that only target CPUs, where asynchronous parallel execution
might not be productive.

## Motivating Examples

### Basic Overlap

Modern computers have many different execution units, some
which are fully general, like CPU cores, and others which 
are specialized.  For example, Intel's latest server CPU
(codename: Sapphire Rapids) has at least three different
on-chip accelerators, including the Data Streaming Accelerator
(DSA), which is capable of executing data parallel operations
like fill, copy and compare faster than the CPU cores,
and also asynchronously relative to them.
While current Fortran compilers could utilize the DSA for
`DO CONCURRENT`, the current semantics provide no mechanism 
for the programmer to encourage such a region to be executed
on the DSA while returning control immediately to allow the
CPU to execute the following code.

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/scalable-io-between-accelerators-host-processors.html

Recent NVIDIA GPUs also contain asynchronous copy engines
within the processor, in addition to the asynchronous
DMAs for copying outside of the GPU.

https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/api-sync-behavior.html
https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/en-zz/Solutions/data-center/nvidia-ampere-architecture-whitepaper.pdf

Similar compute engines to DSA exist for the capability
required by Fortran's `MATMUL`, for example.  Processors
from Apple, Intel and NVIDIA have dedicated matrix units,
which are separate silicon from the general purpose logic
and may be capable of executing independently, i.e.
asynchronously.

https://nod.ai/comparing-apple-m1-with-amx2-m1-with-neon/
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html

Even without special processing engines, all modern CPUs,
including ones found in cheap cell phones, contain multiple
cores.  While Fortran permits programs to utilize parallelism
across cores using coarrays and `DO CONCURRENT`, the former
does not support shared-memory and thus requires unnecessary
copies of data between images when cores can access the same
data coherently, and the latter is limited to highly structured
data parallelism and prohibits impure procedures.  There are
uncountable examples of less structured models for multicore
parallelism, including OS threads, that can be expressed in 
terms of asynchronous tasks.  For example, if one has N
independent operations and N cores, annotating the operations
as asynchronous allows them to run in parallel across cores.
While it is possible for compilers to do such transformations,
they rarely do, because proving the profitability is difficult
and being too aggressive here risks offending the user.
This is not unlike the possibility for autoparallelization
of `DO` loops, and the reason why `DO CONCURRENT` exists to
allow programmers to describe the desired behavior of a
program to the compiler.

Finally, and of great relevance to the Fortran community,
are the use of accelerators or coprocessors, which are
attached to CPUs via a high-bandwidth interconnect, and which
support a large portion of Fortran programming language.
Recently, both NVIDIA and Intel have begun to support
`DO CONCURRENT` on GPUs, but the current semantics do not
permit the programmer to describe the asynchronous nature
of GPU computing, which is default in native APIs like
OpenCL, CUDA, HIP and SYCL (or Intel's Data Parallel C++).
Fortran programs that use OpenMP or OpenACC can achieve
asynchronous behavior in `DO CONCURRENT`, but not without
stepping outside of the standard.

### Asynchronous Communication

Asynchronous communication is regarded as an important
tool for scaling distributed applications.  Library-based
communication such as MPI and OpenSHMEM include
non-blocking operations, which are allowed to behave
asynchronously relative to the calling context.
While coarray operations may be asynchronous between images,
i.e. "one-sided", collective operations are synchronous -
there is no mechanism to express a pipeline of collectives,
or overlap of collectives with computation.

### Quantum chemical many-body theory

This is a specific example of the basic overlap described
above, which has been proven to be enormously beneficial
to performance in a real-world scientific application.

Quantum chemical many-body theory requires the computation
of a large number of terms (dozens to hundreds), many of which
are independent of one another.  In a Fortran implementation
where `DO CONCURRENT` and intrinsics like `MATMUL` are capable
of being executed asynchronously relative to the rest of the
program, the availability of an asynchronous or task-like
mechanism allows a more efficient implementation of this than
is otherwise possible.

Shown below is the computational graph associated with one
version of the populare CCSD method.  It has been implemented
using GPU parallelism, and asynchronous execution of 
data parallel kernels and matrix multiplication operations
enables better utilization of the GPU and overlap of 
computation and data movement, leading to a 2.5x speedup
relative to the synchronous GPU implementation.

## Opportunities for Asynchrony in Fortran

There are at least four different types of opportunities
for asynchrony in Fortran:

  1. `DO CONCURRENT` execution on coprocessors, specialized or not.
  2. Data parallel intrinsics such as `MATMUL`.
  3. Coarray communications, especially collectives.
  4. General code not included above.

We will describe the associated use cases in more detail below.

### `DO CONCURRENT`

If `DO CONCURRENT` is executed a separate processor, as is
available with the Intel and NVIDIA compilers today, then
the implementation looks like this:

Before:
```
DO CONCURRENT (i=1:N) SHARED(X,Y,Z)
  Z(i) = X(i) + Y(i)
END DO
CALL toimia()
```

After:
```
COPY X(1:N) and Y(1:N) to GPU
ALLOCATE Z(1:N) on the GPU
INVOKE Z(:) = X(:) + Y(:)
WAIT on the GPU
COPY Z(1:N) to the CPU
CALL toimia()
```

In contrast, by adding the asynchronous feature of OpenACC,
we will achieve the following:

Before:
```
!$ACC PARALLEL LOOP ASYNC
DO CONCURRENT (i=1:N) SHARED(X,Y,Z)
  Z(i) = X(i) + Y(i)
END DO
CALL toimia()
!$ACC WAIT
```

After:
```
COPY X(1:N) and Y(1:N) to GPU
ALLOCATE Z(1:N) on the GPU
INVOKE Z(:) = X(:) + Y(:)
CALL toimia()
WAIT on the GPU
COPY Z(1:N) to the CPU
```

Whichever of the time spent in `toimia()` or WAIT+COPY
is lesser will be eliminated from the program execution
time, because they will happen concurrently.  The pointless 
time spent in WAIT will be replaced with something useful.

### Data parallel operations

NVIDIA Fortran supports execution of numerous data parallel
operations on GPUs, including `MATMUL`, `TRANSPOSE`, and
array assignments.  The underlying library implementation
of these routines in CUDA is naturally asynchronous, but
the Fortran compiler has no standard syntax to expose that
to users.  Today, it must rely on OpenACC directives,
i.e. the `async` statement described above, to allow the
programmer to express their intent and to coordinate one
or more streams of execution that are permitted to execute
asynchronously relative to one another.

It is not possible to solve this problem with `DO CONCURRENT`
because the compiler may map these statements to the GPU,
and Fortran provides no way to map `DO CONCURRENT` to different
devices, or nest multiple `DO CONCURRENT` regions, where the
outer one uses CPU threads and the inner one uses a GPU.

### Asynchronous Communication

In the following program, there is no need to synchronize
images between coarray collectives, or finish any of them
before initiating the PRINT operation.

```fortran
subroutine stuff(A,B,C,D)
implicit none
double, intent(inout) :: A, B, C
double, intent(in) :: D(:)
call co_sum(A)
call co_min(B)
call co_max(C)
print*,D
end subroutine stuff
```

In MPI-3, it is natural to express the independent nature
of these operations using nonblocking collectives.

```fortran
subroutine stuff(A,B,C,D)
use mpi_f08
implicit none
double, intent(inout) :: A, B, C
double, intent(in) :: D(:)
type(MPI_Request) :: R(3)
call MPI_Iallreduce(MPI_IN_PLACE, A, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_SUM, MPI_COMM_WORLD, R(1))
call MPI_Iallreduce(MPI_IN_PLACE, B, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_MIN, MPI_COMM_WORLD, R(2))
call MPI_Iallreduce(MPI_IN_PLACE, C, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_MAX, MPI_COMM_WORLD, R(3))
print*,D
call MPI_Waitall(3,R,MPI_STATUSES_IGNORE)
end subroutine stuff
```

An asynchronous syntax for coarray communications would allow 
Fortran compilers to exploit asynchronous communication libraries
like MPI.

### Other Asynchronous Operations

Any time two or more operations or regions of code contains no 
conflicting data references, they may be executed independently.
In theory, compilers can recognize this automatically, but as
nearly all forms of asynchronous execution require non-zero
runtime overhead, compilers will not do so unless they can
prove profitability.  Proving both the lack of conflicting
data references and profitability is extremely difficult.
This is the reason why essentially all successful implementations
of parallelism and asynchrony are explicit.

In the most explicit forms of asynchrony, the programmer creates
a thread in their program and associates with it a procedure
to execute, and conflicting data references, known as race
conditions, must be dealt with explicitly using atomic operations
or other synchronization primitives.

In Ada, the underlying mechanism of asynchrony is not exposed,
and the programmer describes tasks, which will be implemented
using threads or similar, by the Ada runtime library.  Because
Ada tasks are permitted to synchronize, e.g. using the 
rendezvous, they must be implemented in such a way that task
synchronization cannot deadlock.  This requires that tasks
be mapped to parallel execution agents or that the runtime
library schedule tasks concurrently, e.g. using coroutines.

In contrast to Ada, OpenMP tasks are not required to use
independent execution agents and therefore cannot synchronize
with one another without the possibility of deadlock, in
contrast to OpenMP threads.  Similarly, OpenACC `async`
does not require an independent execution agent and cannot
synchronize with other asynchronous regions.

While Ada, C and C++ allow tasks/threads to synchronize,
but OpenMP tasks and OpenACC async may not, they both
permit essentially arbitrary code to execute within them,
limited only by the semantics of concurrent data access.
All of the above provide mechanics for describing the
potential for concurrent data access, whether or not they
permit such access to implement synchronization.

## Syntax and Semantics for Fortran Asynchrony

The terms asynchronous, concurrent and parallel are heavily
used in computing, not always in consistent ways.
Because Fortran already defines ASYNCHRONOUS in the context
of data, we will not reuse it to describe execution,
at least as syntax.  We will however, use the term to describe
when execution units are independent of one another.

Inspired by Ada, the syntax `TASK` will be used to describe
a region that is asynchronous relative to the parent task.
However, like OpenMP tasks, Fortran tasks should not permit
synchronization between tasks since this requires a more
involved implementation.  Like `DO CONCURRENT`, a `TASK`
is a programmer hint that it is allowed, desired, and/or
profitable to implement the contained code using an
asynchronous mechanism, such as an OS thread or a dedicated
execution unit that operates independently of the primary
CPU computing logic.

A `TASK` extends `BLOCK`.  It is expected that implementing
`TASK` as `BLOCK` is legal, in the same way that implementing
`DO CONCURRENT` as `DO` is legal, but that high-quality
implementations will do more.

Because tasks - including the implicit task of the program -
may execute independently of one another, the programmer
must not make conflicting data accesses.  Concurrent reads
are not conflicting and always permitted.  Writes that are
concurrent with other reads or writes will have
unspecified, implementation-defined behavior.
Unlike `DO CONCURRENT`, which explicitly prohibits impure
procedures, Fortran tasks may call any procedures.
The burden is on the programmer to avoid conflicting data
accesses, in the same way that coarray programs should not
do so.

While tasks execute independently of their parent task,
a sequence of tasks created by the same parent will
execute in sequence relative to one another.  In order
to relax this behavior, tasks may be associated with
different streams of execution.  A stream of execution
for tasks is labeled with an integer.

Streams of tasks are synchronized to the parent task via
the `TASK WAIT [(stream-number[,stream-number]...)]` statement, where `stream-number` is a *scalar-integer-expression*.  If no stream
index is provided, the `TASK WAIT` statement synchronizes
all streams.

The above syntax and semantics of streams is similar to
OpenACC `async`, and thus is known to be implementable
by multiple compilers.  It is also similar to OpenMP
constructs with `NOWAIT` or tasks without dependencies.

Ada tasks provide a number of important semantics to exclude
problematic programs.  For example, a parent task may
not terminate while a child task has an outstanding data
reference, since this would create incorrect and difficult
to debug programs.  Similarly, Fortran tasks implicitly
wait on child tasks unless the child task contains no references
to data associated with the parent task.

("Concurrent and Real-Time Programming in Ada" by Alan Burns and Andy Wellings)

Fortran tasks need a way to describe the access properties of
data.  Locality specifiers are similar to what OpenMP and OpenACC
use to describe the behavior or asynchronous/task regions and can
be reused.  A Fortran `TASK` region begins with `LOCALITY` statements
such as the following:

```fortran
TASK [(stream-number)]
  LOCALITY(SHARED) :: X(:) ! shared but conflicting accesses are prohibited
  LOCALITY(LOCAL_INIT) :: IBEGIN, IEND, IX
  REAL :: A
  A = COS(IX)
  X(IBEGIN:IEND) = A
END TASK
```

The above task assigns to a range of the array X, as prescribed by
the indices provided by the parent task.

The `REDUCE` locality specifier is not permitted in tasks.
All data declared within a task cannot be accessed by the parent
but may be accessed by child tasks, according to the child tasks
locality statements.
